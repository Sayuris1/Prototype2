# Day 1 - 14/12/2021

**Hello World!!!** After trashing lots of projects and starting over again and again, I decided to change some things to release this time. Here is the plan:

### Plan:

* Design every part before starting (Even though it's going to change.).
* Add those parts deadlines. Make those deadlines x2 longer. Why? Because gamedev works like that.
* Document everything.
* Make the design ***very very very small***.
* Don't use place holders. They waste time and make harder to see what is wrong.
* Focus on screen composition. ( Can't draw shit anyways, don't have any aesthetic sense either. That's hard. )
* As Jonathan said:
    >Keep them playable and just make them better.
* Need to fill up my portfolio before graduating. So after one month of developing, test the game a little bit. If it looks promising, two more months before deadline, if it's not, only one month. ***RELEASE AFTER THAT DEADLINE***
* Don't mix marketing with advertising, make the game marketable from the start. If it ***LOOKS*** good, start advertising. If it has a theme that's advertisable advertise close (maybe after) the release.
  * Basically think about the hooks from the start, add as much as you can. Advertise visual hooks as soon as possible. Advertise other hooks close the release.
* Don't be shy while advertising but don't forget about peoples power struggles and agreeableness.
* Not every game needs to be an **art game**, other games can talk to people, make them feel something too. They too are ***art***. And there is no way to create **art** by trying to create **art** is there?
* No need to try to invent a genre or create a unique mechanic. Same mechanics can create unique experiences if there is some differences.

Those are my main pillars, going to come here often and check if I'm off the road.
